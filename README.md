# DFE Software Development Bootcamp Final Project.

**Why we are doing it.**

The task for our final project is to create a Spring Boot API, with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during training. This will test our knowledge and what we've learnt over the past 10 weeks and be able to put it into practice. 

**How I expected the challenge to go.**

I expect to encounter a few issues along the way, but I am confident of being able to fix the bugs and correct my code to achieve the goal of creating my first API. It will have full functionality and I hope to be able to add to it in the near future.

**What went well/what didn't go to plan.**

The first few days of the project went well then I encountered some issues with my syntax on Thursday so the result of this was that my code wouldn't run. I started to go back through each class and analyse each method and constructor before establishing the issues were minor and luckily easily solved. 
Once these syntax issues were fixed I made really good progress late on Thursday evening which put me back on target with my deadline and staying on track with my Jira board. 
I have learnt to check the code thoroughly before moving on, even if the code isn't showing any errors, doesn't mean that there aren't hidden problems like case sensitive Data types. 
I am also aware that putting my price within the menu class wasn't the best option as it doesn't have context. This is something I will improve for the future revision of my project. I would also like to expand on the project to include a drinks menu and an order functionality class too.
There were some stretch goals which I added to my Jira board which I didn't get to complete but may return to these for future revisions.


## Project Planning ##
To plan the project I used JIRA, which allowed me to break the tasks down and prioritise both the tasks and my time in order for me to achieve the MVP for the deadline.
